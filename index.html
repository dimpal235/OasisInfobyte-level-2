          <h2>First Female teacher of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>         Savitribai Phule was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. 
                Along with her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India. 
                She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. 
                Robert May of the London Missionary Society was the first person to open a school exclusively for girls[3] in the region of Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818.
                She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender.

          <h1><u>Education</u></h1>

          
          <p>
                      Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.
             After completing her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.
             She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Pune.
             Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.
          </p><br>
        
          <h1><u>career</u></h1>
          

          <p>
                     After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada in Pune. 
                She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar[1] who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao. Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. 
                Bhide Wada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhide Wada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies.
                By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled. Like the curriculum, 
                the teaching methods employed by the three schools differed from those used in government schools. The author, Divya Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were regarded as being superior to those used by government schools.
                As a result of this reputation, the number of girls receiving their education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government schools.
          </p><br>

          <h1><u>Personal life</u></h1>
          <p>
                Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. 
                However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.[9] It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow. 
                Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889.
